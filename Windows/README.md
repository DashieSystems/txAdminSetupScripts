## OS Requirements
You can use Windows Server 2016 or 2019. I'd refrain from using 2012/R2 as it's nearing EoL and is just... garbage compared to 2016 and 2019.

While you *can* use Windows 10, it's designed to put priority to foreground user tasks, whereas Windows Server is designed to prioritize background tasks. Just use Windows Server when possible.
